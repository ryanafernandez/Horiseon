# Horiseon

## Description

The motivation for this project was to refactor the webpage for Horiseon, a Social Solution Services company. The existing codebase was refactored to satisfy
web accessibility standards and modern HTML and CSS practices. 
- Alt attributes were added to all images so that users using assitive technologies can access all content within the webpage. 
- The HTML code was restructured using semantic HTML elements and comments were added to describe each element. 
- The CSS code was made more efficient by removing any redundant CSS selectors and properties.

These changes improve the codebase's accessibility for assitive technology users and makes improvements to the readability of the code for developers.

This project highlights the importance of a webpage's accessibility, semantic HTML elements, and efficient/consolidated CSS selectors and properties.
